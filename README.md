script for mining crypto coins

I created this script to upload a miner you need to make adjustments as you want to see that line seven is commented, if you run this script with the same configuration as this with the uncommented line will automatically overload the processing by paralyzing the target being nesting to restart and modify your / etc / contab file


You can find the miners here:https://minergate.com/downloads

obs: the mining file must be on another server, do not try to put the minergate address because it will not work
